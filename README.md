This project focuses on hands-on exploration of operating system internals using the xv6 operating system. The main goal is to gain practical experience with kernel development, system calls, process management, and CPU scheduling policies. Throughout the assignment, we compile and run xv6, develop user-space programs, and extend kernel functionality by implementing new system calls that interact with process control blocks. In addition, the project involves modifying core kernel components such as exit, wait, and the scheduler to support advanced features, including exit messages and multiple scheduling policies. Finally, different scheduling algorithms—priority-based scheduling and a simplified Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)—are implemented, tested, and compared to understand their impact on system behavior and performance. Overall, the project strengthens understanding of how operating systems manage processes, memory, and CPU resources at a low level.
